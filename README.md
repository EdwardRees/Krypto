# Krypto

A simple Math game. The user is given 5 random numbers and a number to calculate. The number to calculate is the date in this case. The user can use +, -, *, /, and () to formulate the calculation expression.

## Dependencies

Python3

## Usage

In your terminal, run:

```bash
  python3 list.py
```

5 numbers will be generated and the number to calculate will also be given. Input the arithmetic statement and the program will calculate the output. If the results are correct, the program will say that the calculation was correct. Otherwise, it will print out the supposed value. Additionally, if invalid numbers are used - meaning numbers that weren't generated - the program will print out an error message and stop.
